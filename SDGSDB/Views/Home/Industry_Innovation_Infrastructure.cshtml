                                The UN has defined 8 <em>Targets</em> and 12 <em>Indicators</em> for SDG 9. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote
                                the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
