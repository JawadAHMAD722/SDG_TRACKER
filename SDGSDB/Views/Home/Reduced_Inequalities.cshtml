                            <p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/">UN explains</a>: <q>The international community has made significant strides towards lifting people out of poverty.  The most vulnerable nations – the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction.  However, inequality still persists and large disparities remain in access to health and education services and other assets.</q></p>
