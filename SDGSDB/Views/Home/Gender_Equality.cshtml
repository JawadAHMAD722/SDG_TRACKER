                            <p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/">UN explains</a>: <em>&quot;Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.</em></p>
                            <p><em>Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large.&quot;</em></p>
                            <p>
                                The UN has defined 9 <em>Targets</em> and 14 <em>Indicators</em> for SDG 5. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote
                                the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
