						<h1>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all</h1>
						<div>
							<p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/">UN explains</a>: <em>&quot;Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential.</em></p>
							<p><em>Transitioning the global economy towards clean and sustainable sources of energy is one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Sustainable energy is an opportunity – it transforms lives, economies and the planet.&quot;</em></p>
							<p>
								More information on energy access and sources can be found at the <em>Our World in Data</em> entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources">Energy Production &amp; Changing Sources</a>,
								<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/renewables">Renewables</a>, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels">Fossil Fuels</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The UN has defined 5 <em>Targets</em> and 6 <em>Indicators</em> for SDG 7. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote
								the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

					<p>
						This is measured as the share of the total population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking. Access to clean fuels or technologies such as clean cookstoves reduce exposure to indoor air pollutants, a leading cause
						of death in low-income households.
